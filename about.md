## ...the blog

This is a blog about concepts, methods, or ideas I come across in my studies and research in quantum computing that I find beautiful or otherwise worth sharing. Due to the broadness of the field, topics originate from maths, physics, and computer science. 
I believe in powerful ideas and high-level intuition and thus try my best to emphasize those. On the other hand, I also believe in getting your hands dirty and working out the nitty-gritty details. Thus, posts may well end up quite technical sometimes.
Hopefully, in a near future, this blog will also contain some original ideas.

## ...the author

My name is Marcel Hinsche and I am currently a master's student working on quantum computing at Free University Berlin. In 2017, I obtained a bachelor's degree in physics at Free University Berlin. In 2018, I interrupted my consecutive master's degree in physics to do [Part III maths](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Part_III_of_the_Mathematical_Tripos) at Cambridge University where I focused on courses in theoretical physics.
Nowadays, quantum computing is my field of choice because of its purity, beauty, and timeliness.
